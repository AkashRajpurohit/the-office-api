# Contributing

There are two ways you can contribute, one is by adding more quotes. You can do this by adding the quotes to the JSON array which is available [here](/data/quotes.json).

Another way to contribute is if you find any bugs, you can report them by creating [issues](https://github.com/AkashRajpurohit/the-office-quotes-api/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) or better, fix them and open a pull request.

Other than fixing bugs, we can expose more endpoints on this API as per the requirements so feel free to open [feature requests](https://github.com/AkashRajpurohit/the-office-quotes-api/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) and let's discuss it there.

So go ahead, [fork this repo and send PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to start contributing üçª
